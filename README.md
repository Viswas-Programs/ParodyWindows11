# ParodyWindows11
A parody of an operating system. the name I chose is Windows 11
Look for more in the wiki of my project in (https://github.com/Viswas-Programs/ParodyWindows11/wiki) there.

ISSUE: Becuase of GitHub raw files not working, neither the installer nor the update manager will work. so untill that issue is fixed in github's side, those 2 programs won't run!

Easy setup (if github servers work): Use the windows 11 installer file and that's it!

Manual Setup:

Step1: Download the windows 11 file

Step2: Download the ProgramFiles zip file and extract that thing into the environment.

Step3: make a new file "accConfiguration1.conf" (yes the file type is .conf) and give your username in first line and password in second line.

Now the directory structure should look similar to this

YOURENV/

---------ProgramFiles/

------------------Icons/

---------------------------ALLICONS

------------------All Apps

------------------accConfiguration.conf

---------Users/

------------------All folder stuff

---------Windows 11.py

---------theme_config.txt

If so, you're officially done with the manual setup! have a great time playing around!
