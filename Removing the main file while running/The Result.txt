It was easy to delete it, and it was all fun and games untill you reboot! it won't boot up!
Simply because the shell cannot find the Windows 11 File!
To fix this, you need to cd into the ProgramFiles directory, and run the Command Prompt
Then, cd back to the Main ParodyWindows11 Folder where winodws file once existed.
There, then run sfcRepair -online command. Boom, it will work!

Damage:
5/10 - NO harm intended, just fun, easily repairable!
